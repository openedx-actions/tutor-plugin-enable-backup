## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Please note that this repository uses [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated processessing of commits and pull requests, and package publication for new releases. Please note the following about your commit message:

- pull requests can be approved and merged by any **two** authorized core committers
- only the 'next' branch can be merged to main. Thus, your Pull Request should be created from the 'next' branch
- we use [Angular commit message format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format). See below
- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Branches associated with CI automation

| Branch     | Description                                                                                           |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| main       | commits are prohibited. Only accepts automated merges via Github Actions                              |
| next       | this is the branch that I (Lawrence) primarly use for normal code maintenance                         |
| next-major | special use, in the unlikely event that we ever bump beyond version 1.x.x                             |
| beta       | if you're working on something large then merge here before doing anything in 'next'                  |
| alph       | if you're doing some really big then start here                                                       |

### About the Angular commit message format

An example:

```bash
  git commit -m "fix: fix bug in the yadda yadda step"
```

Your commit message should be prefixed with one of the following:

| Prefix   | Description                                                                                           |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| build    | changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example - scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm) |
| ci       | changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: Github Actions, CircleCi, SauceLabs)     |
| docs     | documentation only changes                                                                            |
| feat     | a new feature                                                                                         |
| fix      | a bug fix                                                                                             |
| perf     | a code change that improves performance                                                               |
| refactor | a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                                             |
| test     | adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                     |

More generally, less is more: don't use two words where one will suffice. Simple words are better than fancy words.
